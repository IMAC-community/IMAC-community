# Workshops Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `Workshops` subdirectory in the Education module hosts materials specifically designed for interactive, hands-on learning sessions. These workshops aim to provide deeper engagement with complex topics, collaborative problem-solving, and practical application of marine AI techniques using real or representative datasets.

## Key Focus Areas

-   In-depth exploration of specific marine AI methodologies.
-   Collaborative data analysis and model building sessions.
-   Practical application of tools and techniques to solve marine science challenges.
-   Development of end-to-end project workflows.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks and materials planned for this directory include:

-   `Data_Analysis_for_Oceanographers_Workshop.ipynb`: A hands-on workshop guiding oceanographers and marine scientists through practical data analysis techniques using AI/ML tools.

Workshop materials may also include supplementary datasets, presentation slides, and facilitator guides.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

Workshop materials follow the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure detailed in the main `Education/README.md`. The focus is on interactive learning, skill development through practice, and fostering a collaborative environment.

Education Directory

Purpose: The Education directory provides learning materials and curriculum scaffolds to educate students and new contributors in marine AI, with a particular focus on an eDNA curriculum. This includes Jupyter notebooks designed as interactive lessons or assignments, following best practices for pedagogy. The goal is to make the consortium’s work accessible and reproducible for learners, enabling them to engage with real data and tools through guided exercises. Education resources ensure that the knowledge and tools developed by iMAC are transferred widely, empowering a new generation of marine AI professionals and citizen scientists.

Key Agentic Execution Principles (Education):
    •	Clarity & Incremental Learning: Agents (in the role of tutors or content creators) must prioritize clear explanations and step-by-step progression of concepts. Notebooks in this domain are written to be self-explanatory, with agents anticipating where a learner might get confused and providing hints or context. The principle is to scaffold learning – start simple, then gradually introduce complexity – so that even autonomous tutoring agents can adapt to a learner’s pace.
    •	Interactive Engagement: Education notebooks encourage interaction. They include exercises, questions, and visualizations for learners to explore. If an AI agent is guiding a user, it should prompt the user to think or try something rather than just presenting results. This principle aligns with the idea of learning-by-doing: the agent might ask the student to make a hypothesis before revealing an analysis outcome.
    •	Assessment & Feedback: Many education notebooks double as assignments. They include embedded tests or checkpoints to automatically assess a learner’s work. Agents can utilize these to give immediate feedback. For example, after a coding exercise, an agent could run hidden tests (using NBGrader’s framework) and then either congratulate the user or offer a hint if the solution is incorrect. This ensures an autonomous yet supportive learning experience.
    •	Accessibility & Inclusivity: Educational content should be accessible to a broad audience. Agents preparing these notebooks use simple language (jargon is explained), provide alt text for images/graphs, and ensure that content meets accessibility standards (for example, using colorblind-friendly palettes in charts). The design is inclusive, considering learners from different backgrounds and with different needs.

Guidance on Context & Structure (Education):
    •	Context Storage & Retrieval: In an educational context, context includes prior knowledge and learning progress. While this is not a traditional data context, an agent-tutor might keep track of which modules a student has completed or where they had difficulties. For the notebooks themselves, context means any initial data or setup required for the lesson. For example, a lesson on eDNA analysis might require a small example dataset; the notebook should include code to fetch or generate this (keeping it small and embedded for ease). If multiple lessons build on each other, ensure they store results that the next lesson can pick up (for instance, Lesson 1 might save a cleaned dataset that Lesson 2 then uses, or a learner’s trained model from one exercise could be reused later). The Core context could also maintain an educational progress log if implementing a more complex adaptive learning system with an agent tracking progress.
    •	Notebook Structure: Education notebooks should be structured for pedagogy:
    •	Learning Objectives: At the top, list what the learner will know or be able to do after the lesson. This aligns the expectations.
    •	Background: Provide necessary theory or context (e.g., an overview of what eDNA is and why it’s useful). Keep this concise and high-level, possibly with links to further reading.
    •	Step-by-Step Activities: Break the lesson into a sequence of tasks or questions. Each step might be a short explanation, followed by an exercise (could be a coding task or answering a question). Use clear markers like Exercise 1: and have placeholders where learners input their answers or code.
    •	Solution/Feedback: If using NBGrader, some cells will be designated for automated tests or solutions. Typically, an assignment notebook will hide the solutions and only provide tests that run after student submission. In our scaffold, we include comments to indicate where an agent or instructor would place these tests.
    •	Summary: At the end, recap what was learned and perhaps pose an open-ended question to encourage further exploration.
Each educational notebook is also written in a friendly, encouraging tone to keep learners motivated.
    •	Inter-Module Communication: While the Education module is mostly one-way (providing content to people), it can still leverage other modules. For example, an educational notebook might use a dataset from the Science module to give students a real-world example, or demonstrate a simplified version of a model from the Software module. Conversely, if students or participants generate interesting findings or models in an educational setting, those could be fed back (with curation) into the main project. From an agent perspective, a tutoring agent might decide that a learner is ready to engage with the “real” Science notebooks after completing some training, effectively linking the Education context with active project contexts. Moreover, the Education materials themselves should be open for community contributions, reflecting decentralization: instructors from different institutions might add new lessons or translate materials, etc., without affecting core operations.

NBGrader-Compatible Scaffold: The eDNA curriculum subdirectory is structured to support NBGrader (the Jupyter Notebook grading system). Each lesson or assignment notebook is written to be assignment-friendly. According to nbgrader’s design, instructors can include tests and solutions in the “source” version of a notebook and then generate a student version without solutions ￼. Our scaffold marks where these go. The directory may include an nbgrader_config.py and folders like source/ and release/ if we were to fully implement the NBGrader setup. For now, the focus is on providing notebook templates that could be used within such a system.

(NBGrader allows instructors to create and grade notebook-based assignments with both coding exercises and written responses ￼. The eDNA curriculum notebooks are written to be compatible with this approach, meaning they have clear demarcations for autograding tests and use stable IDs on tasks so that grading is reliable.)

Stubbed Jupyter Notebook Templates (Education):

• Lesson1_Intro_to_bio_monitoring.ipynb – An interactive notebook introducing students to the fundamental concepts of biological monitoring (bio-monitoring). Students will learn about the importance of bio-monitoring, its applications in marine science, and basic data collection methods. Exercises include identifying different bio-monitoring techniques and interpreting example datasets.

• Lesson2_Categories_of_biomonitoring_data.ipynb – This notebook guides learners through various categories of biomonitoring data, such as visual observations, acoustic data, and remote sensing data. Activities involve classifying provided example data into relevant categories, and exercises offer immediate feedback through automated NBGrader-compatible tests.

• Lesson3_eDNA.ipynb – An interactive lesson notebook specifically focused on environmental DNA (eDNA). Students will explore how eDNA is used in marine monitoring, practice loading and analyzing small DNA sequence datasets, and perform basic data interpretation tasks. Embedded exercises (e.g., filtering sequences for specific marine species) provide immediate, automated feedback for student submissions, using NBGrader-compatible testing.

Below is the stub for Lesson1_Intro_to_bio_monitoring.ipynb (Education eDNA curriculum subdirectory, source version):

iMAC Mission: The International Marine AI Consortium aims to advance ocean science and conservation through collaborative development of open-source AI solutions and widespread knowledge sharing.
Notebook Purpose: Interactive introductory lesson (Lesson 1) on bio-monitoring concepts and basic methods used in marine science. Includes explanatory text, engaging activities, and coding exercises with embedded tests for immediate feedback (NBGrader compatible).
Metadata: {“module”: “Education”, “curriculum”: “Bio-monitoring”, “lesson”: 1, “topic”: “Intro to Bio-monitoring”, “assignment”: true}

(Within this lesson notebook, subsequent cells would present content and exercises clearly. For example, an Exercise cell might prompt: “Describe three bio-monitoring methods commonly used in marine environments.” A following hidden Test cell (marked with # NBGRADER TEST in comments) would automatically evaluate student answers for key terms or structures.)

# Tutorials Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `Tutorials` subdirectory within the Education module is dedicated to providing focused, step-by-step guides on specific tools, techniques, concepts, and workflows relevant to marine artificial intelligence. These tutorials are designed to be self-contained and allow learners to quickly grasp and apply new skills.

## Key Focus Areas

-   Introduction to core AI/ML concepts for marine applications.
-   Guides on using specific software libraries or tools (e.g., Python libraries for data analysis, GIS tools).
-   Tutorials on common data processing and visualization techniques.
-   Walkthroughs of example analyses or model-building processes.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks planned for this directory include:

-   `Intro_to_Marine_AI.ipynb`: An introductory tutorial to the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence as applied to marine science.

This collection will be expanded to cover a wide range of topics beneficial for newcomers and experienced researchers alike.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

Tutorials in this subdirectory adhere to the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure outlined in the main `Education/README.md`. The emphasis is on clarity, practical examples, and enabling learners to achieve specific learning objectives efficiently.

# Education Directory README

## Purpose

The Education directory provides learning materials, curriculum scaffolds, tutorials, and workshop resources to educate students, researchers, and new contributors in the field of marine AI. It aims to make the iMAC consortium’s work accessible and reproducible for learners, enabling them to engage with real data, tools, and AI methodologies through guided exercises and interactive sessions. The goal is to foster widespread knowledge transfer and empower a new generation of marine AI professionals and citizen scientists.

## Key Agentic Execution Principles (Education)

-   **Clarity & Incremental Learning:** Materials prioritize clear explanations and a step-by-step progression of concepts, designed to be self-explanatory and adaptive to a learner’s pace.
-   **Interactive Engagement:** Notebooks and workshop materials encourage interaction through exercises, questions, and visualizations, promoting learning-by-doing.
-   **Assessment & Feedback:** Educational resources often include embedded tests or checkpoints for self-assessment, with mechanisms for providing feedback to learners.
-   **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Content is designed to be accessible to a broad audience, using clear language, explaining jargon, and considering diverse learning needs.

## Guidance on Context & Structure (Education)

-   **Context Storage & Retrieval:** Educational context includes prerequisite knowledge and learning progress. Notebooks may require small example datasets, with code provided to fetch or generate them. Outputs from one lesson might serve as inputs for another.
-   **Notebook Structure:** Educational notebooks are structured for pedagogy:
    -   **Learning Objectives:** Clearly stated at the beginning.
    -   **Background:** Concise theory or context with links for further reading.
    -   **Interactive Content:** Code cells for exercises, data manipulation, and visualization.
    -   **Explanatory Text:** Markdown cells explaining concepts and code.
    -   **Exercises/Questions:** Embedded throughout to test understanding.
    -   **Summary:** Recap of learning and potential next steps.
-   **NBGrader Compatibility:** Where applicable (especially for structured lessons), notebooks are designed to be compatible with NBGrader for assignments and automated feedback.

## Subdirectories

This directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

-   `Tutorials/`: Contains step-by-step guides and introductory materials on specific tools, techniques, or concepts in marine AI.
-   `Workshops/`: Houses materials for hands-on, interactive workshops designed for deeper engagement with particular topics or datasets.

Each subdirectory has its own `README.md` with further details and a list of relevant educational resources.

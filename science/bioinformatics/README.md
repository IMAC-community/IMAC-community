# Bioinformatics Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `bioinformatics` subdirectory within the iMAC Science module is focused on the application of computational methods to analyze biological data, particularly molecular data derived from marine environments. This includes processing and interpreting data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics (especially environmental DNA - eDNA).

## Key Focus Areas

-   Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis pipelines.
-   Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data processing.
-   Phylogenetic analysis.
-   Comparative genomics of marine organisms.
-   Identification of biomarkers for ecosystem health.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks in this directory include:

-   `Marine_eDNA_Analysis.ipynb`: A template for executing eDNA analysis pipelines, from raw sequence data to biodiversity assessment.

This collection will expand to cover various bioinformatics workflows relevant to marine science.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

All activities and resources in this subdirectory align with the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure detailed in the main `Science/README.md`. Emphasis is placed on creating reproducible, well-documented, and collaborative bioinformatics workflows.

"""
Nanopore Denoising for Marine eDNA

Long-read sequencing has characteristic error patterns that must
be corrected before downstream analysis. Marine sequences pose
unique challenges due to high AT content in some organisms.

Key Error Types in Nanopore:
1. Homopolymer errors (e.g., AAAA might be read as AAA or AAAAA)
2. Systematic errors in specific sequence contexts
3. Higher error rates in AT-rich regions

Marine-Specific Challenges:
- Many marine bacteria are AT-rich (up to 70% AT)
- Low biomass samples have low coverage
- Need to preserve natural sequence diversity

    1. Homopolymer Errors (Most Common)
       - AAAAA might be read as AAAA or AAAAAA
       - Worse for longer homopolymers
       - Example: TTTTTT ‚Üí TTTTT (deletion)
    
    2. Context-Dependent Errors
       - Certain sequence patterns are error-prone
       - e.g., GAGAGA repeats
       
    3. AT-Rich Region Errors
       - Higher error rates in AT-rich sequences
       - Common in marine bacteria!
       
    4. Strand Bias
       - Template vs complement strand differences
       - Can help with error correction
    
    Marine Impact:
    - Many marine microbes are naturally AT-rich
    - Must distinguish errors from real AT-richness
    - Low biomass = low coverage = harder correction

"""
Temporal Analysis of Marine Metabolic Functions

Ocean systems show strong seasonal patterns driven by:
- Light availability (summer vs winter)
- Stratification (mixing vs stable)
- Nutrient availability (upwelling events)
- Temperature cycles

This module detects trends and anomalies in metabolic
potential over time.

Marine-Specific Abundance Normalization

Ocean samples require special normalization due to:
- Variable biomass across depths (surface 10-100x more than deep)
- Salinity effects on DNA recovery efficiency
- Temperature-dependent metabolic rates
- Pressure effects on gene expression

These corrections ensure accurate comparison between samples
from different ocean environments.

Marine eDNA Quality Control Module

This module implements Nanopore-specific quality control with marine
contamination detection. It ensures only high-quality marine sequences
proceed to analysis.

Scientific Rationale:
Marine eDNA samples often contain terrestrial contamination from
handling or atmospheric deposition. Long-read sequencing provides
unique opportunities to detect chimeric sequences that might indicate
contamination events.

Key Features:
- Length filtering optimized for marine microbial genes
- Quality score thresholds tuned for Nanopore chemistry
- Contamination detection using curated terrestrial markers
- AT-rich region handling for marine bacteria
- Educational mode with detailed explanations

    📊 Understanding Quality Scores
    
    Phred scores indicate the probability of a base call error:

    - Q30 = 99.9% accuracy (1 error in 1000 bases)
    
    Nanopore typically produces Q7-Q15 scores.

    1. Atmospheric Deposition
       - Pollen and spores fall on ocean surface

    2. River Runoff
       - Soil bacteria from terrestrial systems
       - High after rainfall events
       
    3. Sampling Contamination
       - Human skin/gut microbiome
       - Ship deck contamination
       - Equipment not properly cleaned
       
    4. Cross-Contamination
       - Between samples during processing
       - PCR jumping between samples
    
    Prevention Tips:
    - Use sterile technique
    - Include negative controls
    - Sample away from river mouths
    - Process samples quickly

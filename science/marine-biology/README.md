# Marine Biology Subdirectory README

## Purpose

This subdirectory, `marine-biology`, is dedicated to Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and resources related to marine biological research within the iMAC Science module. It focuses on areas such as biodiversity assessment, ecological modeling, species distribution analysis, and behavioral studies of marine organisms. The goal is to provide tools and templates that enable both AI agents and human researchers to conduct and document marine biology investigations systematically.

## Key Focus Areas

-   Analysis of marine survey data (e.g., visual census, acoustic monitoring).
-   Biodiversity metrics calculation and reporting.
-   Ecological niche modeling.
-   Population dynamics studies.

## Notebooks

This directory will house notebooks such as:

-   `Marine_Biodiversity_Survey_Analysis.ipynb`: A template for analyzing marine biodiversity survey data and generating reports.

Additional notebooks will be added as the project evolves to cover more specific analytical tasks within marine biology.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

Work in this subdirectory adheres to the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure outlined in the main `Science/README.md`. All notebooks aim for reproducibility, clear documentation, and interoperability with other iMAC modules.

# iMAC Consortium Charter

## Mission Statement

The International Marine AI Consortium (iMAC) aims to advance ocean science and conservation through collaborative development of open-source AI solutions and widespread knowledge sharing. We strive to contribute to social welfare by providing new solutions for ocean-related challenges, creating new technological platforms, and fostering new leadership in marine sciences.

## Core Values & Principles

The iMAC operates under the following guiding principles:

-   **Open Collaboration:** We foster an inclusive environment where individuals, research groups, and AI agents can contribute and collaborate openly.
-   **Scientific Rigor:** We uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity, ensuring reproducibility, transparency, and peer review in our research and development.
-   **Ethical AI Use:** We are committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI, prioritizing safety, fairness, and human oversight.
-   **Educational Outreach:** We aim to make marine AI knowledge and tools accessible to a broad audience, including students, citizen scientists, and researchers worldwide, through educational programs and resources.
-   **Decentralization of Research:** We support decentralized approaches to research, enabling distributed data collection, analysis, and model training to empower a global community.
-   **FAIR Data Practices:** We adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for all data and metadata generated and used within the consortium.
-   **Sustainability:** We focus on developing AI solutions that contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of marine ecosystems.

## Governance Notes

(This section outlines the operational framework for the iMAC. It will be further developed by the community.)

-   **Contribution Guidelines:** Details on how new contributors (human or AI) can propose changes, submit code, or add data.
-   **Decision-Making Process:** An outline of how decisions are made within the consortium, including roles, responsibilities, and consensus mechanisms.
-   **Standards Adherence:** Processes for ensuring compliance with relevant standards, including BeBOP Consortium guidelines for marine bioinformatics.
-   **Conflict Resolution:** Mechanisms for addressing disagreements or conflicts within the community.

This charter serves as a foundational document for all iMAC activities and collaborations. It is a living document and may be updated by consensus of the consortium members.

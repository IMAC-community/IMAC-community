# International Marine AI Consortium (IMAC) Charter

## Mission Statement

The International Marine AI Consortium (IMAC) aims to advance ocean science and conservation through collaborative development of open-source AI solutions and widespread knowledge sharing. We strive to contribute to social welfare by providing new solutions for ocean-related challenges, creating new technological platforms, and fostering new leadership in marine sciences.

## Vision

To create a global collaborative ecosystem where marine scientists, technologists, educators, and conservationists work together to develop and deploy AI-powered solutions that monitor, understand, and protect our oceans for current and future generations.

## Core Values & Principles

The IMAC operates under the following guiding principles:

- **Open Collaboration:** We foster an inclusive environment where individuals, research groups, and AI agents can contribute and collaborate openly, transcending institutional and geographical boundaries.
- **Scientific Rigor:** We uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity, ensuring reproducibility, transparency, and peer review in our research and development.
- **Ethical AI Use:** We are committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI, prioritizing safety, fairness, and human oversight.
- **Educational Outreach:** We aim to make marine AI knowledge and tools accessible to a broad audience, including students, citizen scientists, and researchers worldwide, through educational programs and resources.
- **Decentralization of Research:** We support decentralized approaches to research, enabling distributed data collection, analysis, and model training to empower a global community.
- **FAIR Data Practices:** We adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for all data and metadata generated and used within the consortium.
- **Sustainability:** We focus on developing AI solutions that contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of marine ecosystems.
- **Modularity & Interoperability:** We design systems and solutions that are modular, allowing for independent development while ensuring seamless integration across different components.

## Consortium Structure

### Pod-Based Organization

IMAC is organized into five primary pods, each with specific focus areas and autonomous governance:

1. **Core Pod**: Provides overall coordination, maintains shared infrastructure, and ensures alignment with IMAC's mission
2. **Science Pod**: Conducts marine biology and bioinformatics research, develops analytical methodologies
3. **Hardware Pod**: Manages sensor networks, edge computing devices, and physical data collection systems
4. **Software Pod**: Develops AI models, processing pipelines, and simulation environments
5. **Education Pod**: Creates learning materials, conducts workshops, and manages outreach programs

### Governance Framework

#### Decision-Making Process
- **Pod Autonomy**: Each pod maintains local governance for technical decisions within their domain
- **Cross-Pod Coordination**: Regular inter-pod meetings to ensure alignment and integration
- **Consensus Building**: Major consortium-wide decisions require consensus among pod representatives
- **Community Input**: Public RFC (Request for Comments) process for significant changes

#### Roles & Responsibilities
- **Pod Leaders**: Coordinate activities within their pod, represent pod in consortium meetings
- **Contributors**: Develop code, conduct research, create educational content
- **Reviewers**: Ensure quality and alignment with standards through peer review
- **Community Members**: Provide feedback, test solutions, participate in discussions

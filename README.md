## 🌊 Accelerating Marine Data Generation for Biomonitoring and Regeneration Action

The International Marine AI Consortium (IMAC) is an open-source collaborative initiative bringing together technologists, scientists, educators, and conservationists from diverse backgrounds to develop AI-powered solutions for ocean science and conservation.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We aim to advance ocean science and conservation through:
- **Collaborative development** of open-source AI solutions
- **Widespread knowledge sharing** across disciplines and borders
- **Creation of new technological platforms** for marine monitoring
- **Fostering new leadership** in marine sciences

*Learn more in our [Charter](./core/charter.md)*

## 🤝 Why Join IMAC?

Whether you're a marine biologist, data scientist, hardware engineer, educator, or simply passionate about ocean conservation, IMAC provides:

- **Real-world impact**: Contribute to solutions that directly benefit ocean health
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration**: Work with experts from various fields
- **Open science**: All work is open-source and accessible
- **Learning opportunities**: Access educational resources and workshops
- **AI-ready infrastructure**: Designed for both human and AI agent contributions

## 🏗️ How We're Organized: The Pod System

IMAC uses a **pod-based structure** where each pod operates with local autonomy while coordinating with others for integrated solutions:

### 🧭 [Core Pod](./core/README.md)
The coordination hub providing governance, orchestration, and shared infrastructure.
- Maintains the consortium charter and principles
- Manages cross-pod communication protocols
- Provides agent orchestration templates

### 🔬 [Science Pod](./science/README.md)
Conducts marine research with reproducible, rigorous methodologies.
- **Marine Biology**: Species surveys, biodiversity analysis, ecosystem studies
- **Bioinformatics**: eDNA analysis, genomic data processing, taxonomic classification
- Example: Analyze coral reef biodiversity from survey data

### 🔧 [Hardware Pod](./hardware/README.md)
Manages physical devices and edge computing for field deployment.
- **Sensors**: Water quality monitors, underwater cameras, acoustic devices
- **Edge AI**: Deploy models on buoys, drones, and autonomous vehicles
- Example: Calibrate sensors and deploy real-time species detection on underwater drones

### 💻 [Software Pod](./software/README.md)
Develops AI models and computational tools.
- **AI Models**: Species classifiers, ecosystem predictors, anomaly detectors
- **MarineAI-Lab**: Simulation environments for testing algorithms
- Example: Train a neural network to identify marine species from underwater images

### 📚 [Education Pod](./education/README.md)
Creates learning materials and conducts outreach.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on marine AI concepts
- **Workshops**: Hands-on sessions with real data
- **Curriculum**: Structured courses including eDNA analysis
- Example: Interactive notebook teaching students to analyze environmental DNA

# Hardware Pod - Ocean Sensing & Edge AI

## Overview

The Hardware pod is where digital meets physical in our quest to understand the oceans. We develop, deploy, and maintain the sensors, drones, and edge computing devices that serve as IMAC's eyes and ears in marine environments worldwide.

## Purpose & Mission

The Hardware pod:
- **Develops** innovative marine sensing technologies
- **Deploys** autonomous monitoring systems globally
- **Collects** high-quality environmental data
- **Processes** data at the edge for real-time insights
- **Maintains** a reliable network of ocean observers

## Technology Domains

### Underwater Sensors
Measuring the ocean's vital signs:
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen
- **Acoustic Systems**: Marine mammal detection, underwater soundscapes
- **Optical Sensors**: Turbidity, chlorophyll, bioluminescence
- **Chemical Analyzers**: Nutrient levels, pollutant detection

### Autonomous Vehicles
Extending our reach across the seas:
- **Underwater Drones (AUVs)**: Deep-sea exploration, reef surveys
- **Surface Vehicles (ASVs)**: Long-duration monitoring, sample collection
- **Aerial Drones**: Coastal mapping, wildlife surveys, oil spill detection
- **Hybrid Systems**: Multi-domain platforms for comprehensive monitoring

### Edge Computing
Intelligence at the point of collection:
- **Real-time Processing**: On-device AI for immediate insights
- **Data Compression**: Smart filtering to reduce transmission needs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Alert systems for unusual events
- **Power Management**: Optimizing for long-term deployment

### Communication Systems
Connecting the ocean to the cloud:
- **Satellite Links**: Global coverage for remote deployments
- **LoRaWAN Networks**: Low-power, long-range coastal monitoring
- **Acoustic Modems**: Underwater data transmission
- **Mesh Networks**: Resilient multi-node communication

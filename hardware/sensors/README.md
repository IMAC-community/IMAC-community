# Sensors Subdirectory README

## Purpose

This `sensors` subdirectory within the Hardware module is dedicated to Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and documentation related to the diverse array of sensors used in marine AI research. It covers sensor selection, deployment strategies, calibration procedures, data acquisition protocols, and validation testing to ensure high-quality data collection.

## Key Focus Areas

-   Calibration and testing of various marine sensors (e.g., CTD, ADCP, hydrophones, cameras).
-   Standardized data acquisition protocols.
-   Sensor health monitoring and diagnostics.
-   Integration of sensor data streams.
-   Documentation of sensor specifications and operational guidelines.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks in this directory include:

-   `Sensor_Calibration_and_Test.ipynb`: A template for systematic calibration of sensors and testing their performance parameters.

Additional notebooks will address specific sensor types and data processing workflows.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

All work in this subdirectory aligns with the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure outlined in the main `Hardware/README.md`. The emphasis is on safe, reliable, and autonomous sensor operation and data collection.

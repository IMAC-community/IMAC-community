# EdgeAI Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `EdgeAI` subdirectory in the Hardware module focuses on the deployment, management, and operation of Artificial Intelligence models on edge computing devices. These devices operate in the field, often with limited connectivity, providing real-time analysis and decision-making capabilities for marine applications.

## Key Focus Areas

-   Deployment of AI/ML models to various edge hardware platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Google Coral).
-   Performance benchmarking and optimization of models on edge devices.
-   Management of software stacks and dependencies for edge AI.
-   Real-time data processing and inference at the edge.
-   Ensuring robust and autonomous operation of AI models in marine environments.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks planned for this directory include:

-   `EdgeAI_Model_Deployment.ipynb`: A template guiding the deployment of pre-trained models onto edge devices, including setup, validation, and performance logging.

Further notebooks will cover specific edge platforms, model optimization techniques, and operational monitoring.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

Activities in this subdirectory adhere to the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure detailed in the main `Hardware/README.md`. The core aim is to enable autonomous, efficient, and reliable AI model execution directly in the marine environment.

Software Directory

Purpose: The Software directory encompasses the computational and algorithmic development side of the project. This is where code for AI models, data processing pipelines, and simulation environments (the MarineAI-Lab) reside. It provides an environment for agents (and developers) to train and evaluate machine learning models tailored to marine data, simulate scenarios (such as autonomous vehicle navigation or ecosystem models), and develop new software tools. Essentially, the Software module is the sandbox where cutting-edge AI techniques are applied to marine problems, and then prepared for deployment (in Hardware or use in Science workflows).

Key Agentic Execution Principles (Software):
    •	Modular Code & Reusability: Agents should write and use code that is modular and well-documented so it can be easily reused or updated. This means breaking tasks into functions or classes (even within notebooks, using concise code cells and libraries where appropriate). It also involves maintaining version control on models and code – an agent might tag models with version numbers and keep changelogs, ensuring traceability of improvements.
    •	Testing & Verification: Before integrating any new software component (like a machine learning model) into the wider system, it should be tested. Agents are expected to use validation datasets, simulation runs, or unit tests (in code) to verify that the software works as intended. For example, after training an AI model on fish detection, the agent should evaluate it on a test set and perhaps simulate its use in a MarineAI-Lab scenario to observe performance. This principle prevents the propagation of errors to the hardware or science modules.
    •	Continuous Integration of Knowledge: The Software module is where learning loops close. Data from Science or Hardware can flow here to update models (continuous learning). Agents should be able to automatically retrain or fine-tune models when new data arrives, if appropriate, and then deploy updates. The system is agentic in that it can autonomously improve its models over time (with safeguards like not deploying a model that performs worse than the previous version).
    •	Interoperability & Open Standards: Use common data formats and APIs so that software components can talk to each other and to external tools. If the agent uses external libraries or services (say, a cloud AI service or a specialized simulation tool), it should use well-defined interfaces. Also, emphasize open-source principles – any custom code or model architecture developed should be documented and shared in a way that others (or other agents) can understand and build upon, reflecting the consortium’s collaborative spirit.

Guidance on Context & Structure (Software):
    •	Context Storage & Retrieval: Software notebooks handle context like model artifacts, training data, and evaluation results. Large data (like raw training datasets) might not be stored directly in the repo for practicality, but agents should expect to retrieve such data from specified locations (possibly a mounted storage or via download scripts). Each model training notebook should output the model file (e.g. a .pkl or .h5 or ONNX/TensorFlow Lite file) and a metadata file describing the model (training data used, parameters, performance metrics). These outputs become context for the Hardware module (for deployment) and even for Science (a Science notebook might query the model’s performance metadata to decide if new data should trigger retraining). A model registry can be simulated in the Core or Software directory, where the latest model info is kept.
    •	Notebook Structure: Two main categories exist in Software:
    •	MarineAI-Lab (Simulation) notebooks: These might set up a simulation environment (for example, a virtual ocean current environment or a robotic simulator for an autonomous sub). Structure: Setup environment (initialize simulation, define parameters), Execute scenario (run the simulation or experiments, possibly with an agent controlling a virtual vehicle), Results (collect performance metrics, e.g., how well did a navigation algorithm do), Analysis (what does it mean, any improvements needed). These notebooks help agents develop and test algorithms in silico before real-world deployment.
    •	AI Development notebooks: These cover data processing, model training, and evaluation. Structure: Data Loading/Preparation, Model Definition, Training (with progress logging), Evaluation (with clear metrics and maybe confusion matrices or error analysis plots), and Save & Export (persist the model and metrics). Comments should guide the agent on parameter tuning or where to plug in new data.
In both cases, emphasize readability and organization (use section headings within the notebook, meaningful markdown explanations). Agents following these templates will produce outputs that are easy for others to review and build on.
    •	Inter-Module Communication: The Software module often receives data from Science (e.g. a cleaned dataset or feature set ready for model training) and from Hardware (e.g. new images or sensor data that could improve a model). In turn, it produces models or algorithms that go back to Hardware (for deployment on devices) or to Science (e.g. an analysis notebook might call a prediction function provided by Software). To manage this, use a consistent approach to file paths and APIs. For instance, the Marine_Species_Classifier_Training.ipynb could output MarineAI-Lab/models/fish_classifier_v2.onnx and update a models_index.json in Software directory with metadata. The Hardware EdgeAI notebook then looks up that index to fetch the latest model. If using direct function calls, one might factor out common code into a Python module (maybe a Software/utils/ directory with .py files) that both notebooks and agents can import. This fosters reusability and avoids duplication across notebooks.

Stubbed Jupyter Notebook Templates (Software):
    •	MarineAI-Lab: MarineAI_Lab_Simulation_Script.ipynb – A template notebook for running a simulated marine scenario. For example, it might simulate an autonomous research vessel’s route-planning in varying weather conditions. The notebook guides an agent through setting up the simulation (perhaps using a library or custom code), running the simulation with an AI decision-making loop, and then analyzing how well the AI performed (did the vessel reach its destination efficiently? how many obstacles were avoided?). This helps agents refine algorithms before real-world trials.
    •	AI: Marine_Species_Classifier_Training.ipynb – A template for training a machine learning model, for instance a classifier to identify marine species from images or sonar data. It would include steps to load a labeled dataset, define a neural network model, train the model (with periodic logging of accuracy), evaluate it on validation data, and save the trained model and evaluation report. This notebook can be run by an agent whenever new training data is available or when an existing model’s performance needs improvement.

# AI Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `AI` subdirectory within the Software module is dedicated to the core development, training, evaluation, and versioning of artificial intelligence and machine learning models. This is where algorithms are implemented, datasets are processed for training, models are rigorously tested, and production-ready models are prepared for deployment in other iMAC modules (like Hardware/EdgeAI or Science).

## Key Focus Areas

-   Development and implementation of AI/ML model architectures.
-   Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines for model training.
-   Robust model training and hyperparameter optimization workflows.
-   Comprehensive model evaluation and validation using appropriate metrics.
-   Versioning and management of trained models and associated artifacts.
-   Techniques for model interpretability and explainability.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks planned for this directory include:

-   `AI_Model_Training_Pipeline.ipynb`: Establishes a reusable pipeline for training various AI models on marine datasets, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and versioning.

Additional notebooks will cover specific model types, advanced training techniques, and detailed evaluation protocols.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

All activities in this subdirectory align with the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure detailed in the main `Software/README.md`. The focus is on producing high-quality, reliable, and well-documented AI models that can be effectively utilized across the iMAC ecosystem.

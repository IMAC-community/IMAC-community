# MarineAI-Lab Subdirectory README

## Purpose

The `MarineAI-Lab` subdirectory within the Software module provides a dedicated space for creating, managing, and executing simulation environments and tracking controlled experiments. This 'lab' environment allows for the testing of AI algorithms, autonomous agent behaviors, and marine system models in a reproducible and configurable setting before real-world deployment.

## Key Focus Areas

-   Development of simulation environments for marine scenarios (e.g., AUV navigation, ecosystem dynamics).
-   Orchestration and management of complex simulation runs.
-   Tracking and logging of experiment parameters and results.
-   Analysis and visualization of simulation outcomes.
-   Providing a safe sandbox for testing AI decision-making logic.

## Notebooks

Key notebooks planned for this directory include:

-   `MarineAI_Lab_Experiment_Tracker.ipynb`: A template for defining, tracking, and managing experiments within the MarineAI-Lab, including parameter logging and results aggregation.

This collection will expand to include specific simulation setups and analysis tools.

## Agentic Principles & Structure

Work in this subdirectory adheres to the Key Agentic Execution Principles and Guidance on Context & Structure outlined in the main `Software/README.md`. Emphasis is on creating robust, configurable, and well-documented lab environments that facilitate rigorous AI testing and development.

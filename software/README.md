# Software Directory README

## Purpose

The Software directory encompasses the computational and algorithmic development side of the iMAC project. This is where code for AI models, data processing pipelines, and simulation environments (the MarineAI-Lab) reside. It provides an environment for agents and developers to train and evaluate machine learning models tailored to marine data, simulate scenarios, and develop new software tools. The Software module is the sandbox where AI techniques are applied to marine problems and prepared for deployment or use in Science workflows.

## Key Agentic Execution Principles (Software)

-   **Modular Code & Reusability:** Agents write and use modular, well-documented code. Version control for models and code is maintained for traceability.
-   **Testing & Verification:** New software components (e.g., ML models) are tested using validation datasets, simulations, or unit tests before integration.
-   **Continuous Integration of Knowledge:** Data from Science or Hardware can flow here to update models (continuous learning). Agents can automatically retrain or fine-tune models when new data arrives, with appropriate safeguards.
-   **Interoperability & Open Standards:** Common data formats and APIs are used. Open-source principles are emphasized for custom code and model architectures.

## Guidance on Context & Structure (Software)

-   **Context Storage & Retrieval:** Software notebooks handle model artifacts, training data, and evaluation results. Large datasets might be retrieved from specified locations. Model training notebooks output model files and metadata (training data, parameters, performance metrics). This context is vital for Hardware (deployment) and Science (model performance queries). A model registry might be maintained in Core or Software.
-   **Notebook Structure:** Notebooks in this module generally fall into two categories:
    1.  **Lab/Simulation Notebooks (`MarineAI-Lab`):** Focus on setting up, running, and analyzing simulations or controlled experiments. Structure includes setup, execution, and analysis/reporting phases.
    2.  **AI Model Notebooks (`AI`):** Focus on data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and saving. Structure follows a typical machine learning workflow.
    Readability and organization are emphasized in both types.
-   **Inter-Module Communication:** Software modules receive data/requests from Science/Hardware and provide trained models or analysis results. For example, a trained model from the `AI` subdirectory might be passed to `Hardware/EdgeAI` for deployment. The `MarineAI-Lab` might simulate scenarios based on data from `Science` or sensor configurations from `Hardware`.

## Subdirectories

This directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

-   `MarineAI-Lab/`: Contains resources for creating, managing, and running simulation environments and tracking lab-based experiments.
-   `AI/`: Focuses on the development, training, testing, and validation of artificial intelligence models.

Each subdirectory has its own `README.md` with further details and notebook templates.
